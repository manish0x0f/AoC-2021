# Day-1 

part1 of problem is just checking whether next item is greater than current item in an array. simple if condition and maintaining a count to hold the instances where next item is greater than current item.

part2 feels like a sliding window problem, but first I solved through bruteforce approach.I will change to sliding window in next iteration.

going through sliding window concepts from below resources and solved part2 with sliding window solution.

# Day-2 

part1 and part2 feels like a simple parsing problem and solved it in the first go.I didnt see this question related to any concept in CS.
