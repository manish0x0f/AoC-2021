# Day-1 

part1 of problem is just checking whether next item is greater than current item in an array. simple if condition and maintaining a count to hold the instances where next item is greater than current item.

part2 feels like a sliding window problem, but first I solved through bruteforce approach.I will change to sliding window in next iteration.
